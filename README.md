# SVG Logo Builder

![License: MIT ](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

I create this application to review Object Oriented Programing concepts in Javascript and to learn how to use JEST. I create a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file. I learn:  
    - how to create tests using JEST.  
    - how to create classes and use Inheritance in Javascript.
